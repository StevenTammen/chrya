## Please note: this page is in progress

This means, among other things, that:

- Some of the content is not fleshed out, so you should not read more into things than exactly what is there.
- Some sections might have things marked as "TODOs" (e.g., questions or things that must be done). These TODOs should not be taken to be representative of truth in any respect, and indicate areas that need more research and thought. If you have particular knowledge in things related to these, you can help! (Please see: [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/StevenTammen/chrya#contribution-guidelines)).
- There probably will not be any section that pulls everything together in an easily understandable way.

This does not mean that:

- I am not firmly convinced of the veracity of all the content currently published. If I am not sure of something, I don't push it to the website. (This doesn't mean that I won't ever change my positions if I come to learn that I am in error, but that I strive, as much as possible, to only push content to the website if I am absolutely certain that it is true).
- This page cannot be helpful to you in its present form. If you are aware of the limitations of the current state, you may find this page helpful long before I officially publish it.

## Series Overview

Epistemology, as it it commonly defined, is the study of knowledge and justified belief. The [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html), on its [page for epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/), has the following to say about knowledge:

> Thus we arrive at a tripartite analysis of knowledge as [justified true belief]: *S* knows that *p* if and only if *p* is true and *S* is justified in believing that *p*. According to this analysis, the three conditions — truth, belief, and justification — are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for knowledge.

Translation: for you to to know something, the "something" has to be true, you have to actually believe it, and you have to be believing it for good reasons. Loosely speaking, this series will focus on what things are true (Christian sources of truth), the importance of actually believing these sources so as to obtain expriential knowledge (Gk. *epignosis*), and how we know that our belief in these sources is justified.

(Note: it is common to get hung up on terminology, particularly if one is not accustomed to philosophy's nasty habit of imbuing words from everyday life with special significance. The knowledge described by traditional epistemology is so-called "knowledge-that" or propositional knowledge. Thus, "knowing" is used in a very specific technical sense -- not "knowing about" = "conversant with the content of," but "knowing that" = "justified true belief").

For Christians, truth is obtained from God's written Word, and from a relationship with the living Word, Jesus Christ. Science and related disciplines (all of which ultimately come from God) are sources of truth as well, but not the divine, spiritual truth that is the subject of this series.

The fundamental mechanics of Christian epistemology are really pretty simple. God has structured the world in such a way that it shouts His glory and eternal power, and has written eternity on the hearts of men. Collectively, these (and other) general sources of divine truth are known as *general revelation*. To those who respond to general revelation, seeking further knowledge of God, God provides *special revelation* in the form of His inspired Word -- the Bible -- and qualified and prepared teachers to minister it. These are the sources of truth for all Christians. We believe through the free will that comes from the image of God. We are justified in our belief because of the character of God and the promises he has made us.

The reason why more needs to be said is because complications arise. How exactly does one get truth from the Bible? How does one decide if a teacher is of God? Why do some people say that prophecy (which was previously an additional form of special revelation) is still in effect? Why is it that in our modern information age -- wherein we have more potential to know the fullness of God's revealed truth than any time before -- an average Christian knows *less* truth?

## Topics

- Natural revelation and special revelation
- Forms of special revelation before the canon closed
- Inspiration: its implications and its importance
- Logical fallacies regarding appeals to history, authority, and consensus (i.e., "what the church fathers said, what current church leaders say, and what most people believe").
- How lay Christians ought to handle situations when seemingly strong, well-educated Christian teachers take opposing views on important matters. Who should they trust?
- The importance for lay Christians of picking one teaching ministry to trust so as to avoid doubt and anxiety over what is true
- The importance of *epignosis* in the Christian life; the difference between intellectual assent and spiritual truth learned, believed, and applied
- The so-called "fruit test" -- how to tell good teachers from bad teachers
- The proper functioning of teachers within the Church; the gift of teacher in general, who can have it, how they should go about preparing for ministry, etc.
- The importance of the original languages and texts in determining truth (rather than translations)
- Basic hermeneutics -- brief surveys regarding the impact that knowledge of history, ancient cultures, etc. has on interpretation.
- The importance of context in determining meaning

TODO: Determine best way to order materials
TODO: Determine the optimum "depth" of teaching for each topic (not "too much" background necessary in theology, philosophy, etc. to make full use of the materials)
