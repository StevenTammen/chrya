<h1 class="center">Contact</h1>

To allow for selective forwarding and automatic categorization, I have several different email addresses. If you could take a few extra seconds to look at the table below and match up your reason for contacting me with the correct email address, it would be greatly appreciated.

  <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Reason</th>
    <th>Address</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Questions and Correspondance</td>
    <td><a href="mailto:steven@chrya.com">steven@chrya.com</a></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Content Improvements</td>
    <td><a href="mailto:edits@chrya.com">edits@chrya.com</a></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Design Improvements</td>
    <td><a href="mailto:design@chrya.com">design@chrya.com</a></td>
   </tr>
  </table>
